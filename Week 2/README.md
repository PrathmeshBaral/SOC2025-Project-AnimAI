# Week 2 Assignment â€“ Machine Learning Fundamentals with CNN (MNIST)

This assignment focused on classifying handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with `TensorFlow`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib`.

## ðŸ“Œ Why CNNs Over Traditional Models?

Traditional models like **SVM** and **Random Forests** treat every pixel as an independent feature, ignoring spatial patterns. In contrast, **CNNs** are tailored for image data â€” they capture **local structures** (edges, corners, shapes) using convolutional filters, which leads to significantly better performance.  
> âœ… CNNs achieved ~**99.00% accuracy**, whereas traditional models typically reach only 96â€“98%.
